About me 🙇‍♂️

Hey I'm Dyllan, I am from France.

I mostly play Counter Strike, VRC, and probably other games I forgot to write.

✔️ I like : Chill people, respectful, when they talk English or French.

❎ I hate : People who constantly yell everytime they lose, non english/french speakers.

🌐 I usually appear 24/24 online, though I'm not always active.
